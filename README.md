# Starred Package Installer package for Atom.io

Note: Currently failing with the v1.* API. Issues in the issue list to fix these fails. I'll get to them asap, happy to accept pull requests in the meantime.

Usage:

    cmd+shift+P -> "Starred Package Installer" -> enter

Then watch it run.

What does it do?

It runs the apm command

    apm stars --install

Getting the latest version of all of the packages that you have starred on the web.

Note: This is a work in progress, and my first Atom package. I hope that some find it useful.

Please submit bugs, tests and pull requests.

Warning, starring this package has not been tested, and may cause infinite loops or black holes. Use with caution.
